# Support-Vector-Machine-and-RF-Algorithm-Combined-with-Backpropagation-for-Diabetes-Monitoring
This script presents a hybrid system for diabetes prediction. It combines SVM for non-linear pattern detection, Random Forest for robustness and feature importance, and a Neural Network to integrate both outputs via backpropagation. The model ensures high accuracy for healthcare use.
